The command `python -c "import os; print(os.urandom(24).hex())"` is a way to generate a random hexadecimal string using Python directly from the command line. Here's a breakdown:

*   `python`: This invokes the Python interpreter.
*   `-c`: This flag tells Python to execute the following string as a command.
*   `"import os; print(os.urandom(24).hex())"`: This is the Python code being executed.
    *   `import os;`: This imports the `os` module, which provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
    *   `os.urandom(24)`: This function generates 24 random bytes suitable for cryptographic use. The `urandom` function is preferred for security-sensitive applications because it draws from a source of randomness that is considered cryptographically secure.
    *   `.hex()`: This method is called on the bytes object returned by `os.urandom(24)`. It converts the random bytes into a hexadecimal string representation. This is a common format for keys and secrets because it's easily stored and transmitted as text.

In summary, the command generates 24 cryptographically secure random bytes and then converts those bytes into a human-readable hexadecimal string, which is ideal for use as a `cookie_secret`.
